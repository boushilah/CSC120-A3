Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Hadya Abdi, Meron Oumer.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? I attended the office hours held during our Friday class on the 14th of May. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? Java can get tricky because it has quite a lot of keywords. Additionally, since Java is case sensitive, it makes it even more complicated to work with. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? Python is easier to understand and to work with compared to Java. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Not all the mirror words worked as I expected them to and I couldn't figure out how to solve the issue. For the pair, " are, am" when the user input " They are", the reflection becomes " They am" which is not what we intend to return. However, that works perfectly when the input has the subject " you" instead of "they". Also, this assignment was really challenging as I have never used the mirroring function in my life and also the split(). It get more challenging as you try to make it make sense. The program was manageable when I only had to make the bot return only one phrase, however making it mirror the user's input was the real challenge. 

Also, another thing that doesn't make the static Array of responses a good solution is how random it sounds when responding to questions like " what?". The randomness kept throwing me off. Even though it can work to a certain degree, ultimately it's just a foundation for something bigger and not the end soluton. 

Though I did not go to TA hours, I am fortunate enough that one of my friends is a CSC major and helped tremendously to understand what was going on. Using Chatgpt was helpful debbuging but when it came to writing the code, it only came up with somewhat complex programs. However, since I know a few things from c++ I could think through some of the issues, though not all of them. 

As for the advise, I would recommend someone taking this class in the future to give themselves time to work through the questions as it really helps when you are not working under pressure of the deadline.
